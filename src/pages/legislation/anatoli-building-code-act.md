# I. Plots
1. All persons looking to construct new buildings within Anatoli may reserve a plot within the city, subject to the following conditions:
    1. The constructor shall reserve a plot with prior notice to its government.
        1. The builder must specify the following in their notice:
            1. Location of the plot, in terms of street name, or coordinates, where a street name is unavailable
            2. Dimensions of the plot designation
        2. Notices may be sent in writing and/or in a photograph of the plot, with the entire plot and its adjacent street(s) clearly visible.
    2. The builder shall be responsible for ensuring that their construction remains within their plot
        1. Transportation systems shall be permitted to extend construction outside their plot, provided that the tracks are set underground, and the tracks are deep enough such that there is adequate room for construction of other buildings in any spaces they cross.
            1. Surface-level tracks crossing the bounds of a plot shall not be permitted in the state without prior approval by Anatoli. Any unauthorized surface-level tracks shall be removed without warning immediately upon discovery.
        2. Future expansions to a plot shall be granted without prior written consent to the state, provided that the adjacent spaces are empty and have not been claimed.
            1. Should a builder be found to be within another person’s plot, both parties must seek resolution with each other first. If a resolution has not been found in a reasonable amount of time, either party may send a complaint to Anatoli, at which point its government shall resolve the matter.
                1. Should a resolution be dissatisfactory to any party, either party shall have the right to appeal a resolution.
2. Where a plot has been claimed, but it is empty, the plot owner will have 90 days to begin construction, at which point ownership of the plot shall be revoked.
    1. After at least 60 days, the state will give an advance warning that plot ownership will be revoked if construction does not begin.
    2. Once plot ownership has been revoked, the state will publicly notify all members of the public of the plot’s availability. The state will grant ownership of the plot to the first person attempting to claim it.
3. Should the finished construction within the plot, including any parking lots or other outdoor construction be smaller than the originally-specified plot designation, the official plot will be shrinked to the size of the constructed space. The remaining space shall then be made available to other builders.
# II. Safety Code
4. All indoor commercial spaces must have clearly-marked ISO-7010 exit signs at each exit where appropriate.
5. The state reserves the right to inspect any building for violation of the code and for building and building safety recommendations at any time. Its findings shall be shared with the plot's owner and any inspection records shall be made available to any member of the public upon request.
    1. Any buildings failing an inspection for extraneous safety concerns may be closed until all accommodations specified in the inspection are met.
